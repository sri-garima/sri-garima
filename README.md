Introduction
Bike rental systems are becoming increasingly popular in urban areas. This project leverages machine learning to predict the number of bikes rented at any given time, helping to improve the efficiency and user experience of bike rental services.

Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as:

-->Date: The date of the rental.

-->Season: The season (spring, summer, fall, winter).

-->Weather: Weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.).

-->Temperature: The temperature in Celsius.

-->Humidity: The humidity percentage.

-->Windspeed: The wind speed.

-->Rental Count: The number of bikes rented.


Exploratory Data Analysis

We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data better and identify patterns. Key steps included:

--->Visualizing the distribution of rental counts.

--->Analyzing the impact of weather conditions on rentals.

--->Identifying seasonal trends.

Modeling

We used a regression model to predict bike rental counts. The steps included:

--->Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

--->Model Selection: Trying different regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

--->Model Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate model performance.

Results

The final model achieved an R-squared score of 0.85, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual rental counts. The model effectively captures the impact of weather and seasonal variations on bike rentals.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in optimizing bike rental systems. The predictive model can help service providers make data-driven decisions, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
